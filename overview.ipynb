    "# Project\n",
    "\n",
    "Implementation of Epyk started from a need for Python developers to be more involved in the entire application design. As data transformation is key in each product it was important for them to be involved in the final display to ensure a simple and efficient data processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "The need was about using Python to do the data transformation but also the template for the display. A simple prototype using Flask and Jinja proved the feasability but we did not want to change languages... this was the beginning of Epyk.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today Epyk is including multiple Javascript libraries in order to simplify as much as possible the Front End implementation. It will use its rich ecosystem of components plus its internal Javascript tranpiler to render a rich HTML 5 page.\n",
    "\n",
    "Components and JavaScript features are added following request. Do not hesitate to share your needs and we will add this to our roadmap !\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Epyk can be installed easily to an Jupyter Notebook by running the below command \n",
    "\n",
    "> !pip install epyk\n",
    "\n",
    "This will get the latest version of the package to the Pypi repository\n",
    "\n",
    "Once installed it will be possible to prototype and create part of components which can then be reused in your final application. Jupyter is great platform to share code but also to advertise your work but this code should be then used to production with a minimum of changes. In the same way that Codepen is a very efficient plateform to share front end code.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is what this framework should allow you to to both and according to your environment the output generated will be different.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today Epyk ecosystem is using the best of the Javascript and Python ecosystem to allow you to be a full stack developer from Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "So have a look at the tutorials and test it online directly !\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project design\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tutorials\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following links, basic Epyk features will be detailled. This will not present final dashboards as it is more about explaining concept and bricks in order to write entire website and rich web applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reports in Epyk are fully written in Python, transpiled to Javascript so the final result can be integrated to any Javascript framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some work is currently in progress to link all those dashboards to React or Angular frameworks.\n",
    "As you will understand at the end of those tutorial, this integration will not change the API but add new export features.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Go to the tutorial summary](tutorials.ipynb)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Current projects\n",
    "\n",
    "Lot of work is currently started to expend Epyk Ecosystem and ensure that Python develpers can be more involved in Front end implementation. Epyk is a light and independent Python implementation and it is not including any packages to be compatible with any Python framework and also to not reimplement anything for the data transformation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Current repositories\n",
    "- Epyk (core): \n",
    "- Epyk Materials\n",
    "- Epyk Bootstrap\n",
    "- Epyk Engine\n",
    "- Epyk Flask\n",
    "- Epyk Django (In development)\n",

    "\n",
    "Final builds are available on Pypi\n",
    "\n",
    "## Template repositories\n",
    "\n",
    "Those repositories are not packaged, they are collections of examples dedicated to be run locally to produce reports locally. Those templates are not full reports but framework of reports / dashboards illustrating a specific case.\n",
    "\n",
    "Do not hesitate to submit your reports to enrich those repositories.\n",

    "\n",
    "## General rule\n",
    "\n",
    "Any changes or fixes in any Javascript library should be temporary and the issue should be raised to the Javascript framework in order to have a centralised and permanent fix. In the same way it helps Python developer, Epyk framework should benefit to the Javascript community to improve its underlying modules !\n",
    "\n",
    "Same thing, any improvment on the underlying JavaScript modules should be raised directly on the module repositories. An example in Codepen could help explaining the issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Comments\n",
    "\n",
    "- For any questions please use Stackoverflow with the tag epyk\n",
    "- For any request for changes please use the appropriate Github repository\n",
    "\n",
    "<HR>\n",
    "Do not forget that this is a collaborative framework so do not hesitate to give feedbacks and like the different repository to get more visbility.\n",
